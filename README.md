# Resume_Vault
ResumeVault is a Django-based platform where candidates register, upload/update profile photos and resumes and manage personal info/skills. Recruiters browse and filter candidates by name or skill, viewing profiles and downloading resumes. File handling uses Pillow, and async tasks are managed with Celery.
